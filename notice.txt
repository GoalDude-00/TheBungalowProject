Renegade4339 here, I have unfortunate news to tell you all:

I have officially lost my phone whilst in school yesterday,
therefore I won't be able to make updates myself.
I should've been more careful. I'm not sure if I can come
back in full force, especially that my Discord account has been
locked out due to its 2fa as well.

For people who are in the HDest Discord, notify them about this. Stay safe.

Regards: Clance B. Benitez
